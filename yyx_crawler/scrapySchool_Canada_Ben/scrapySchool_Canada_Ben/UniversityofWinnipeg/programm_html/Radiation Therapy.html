<p>PRE-RADIATION THERAPY/ 
RADIATION THERAPY  
</p>
<p>Rad iation Therapists are involved in the p lanning , simu lation and delivery of rad iation treatments 
to patients who have d iseases such as cancer.  Therap ists also perform patien t assessments 
and provide education and emotional support to patients throughout their treatment. 
</p>
<p>Radiat ion Therapists work as members of a team to deliver integrated care to patients. Working in both 
treatment planning and delivery, they are responsible for developing treatment plans and for the operation 
of CT simulators, treatment machines and other related equipment. They maintain patient treatment data, 
interpret treatment plans, administer prescribed treatment, and provide informat ion and support to patients. 
</p>
<p>The joint program leads to a Diploma in Radiation Therapy from CancerCare Manitoba (CCMB) and a 
Bachelor of Science degree (4-year) from The University of W innipeg.  Students complete the 
requirements for a diploma through CCMB, enabling access to the Canadian Association of Medical 
Radiation Technologists certification exams.  Students will complete their 4-year Science degree in 
Radiation Therapy at The University of Winnipeg, which will enable their access to the American Registry of 
Radiologic Technologists certification exam as well as other career and educational opportunities.  
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>Radiation Therapists are employed by hospitals and clinics.    The demographics of the Canadian 
population are reflected in this work force; the number of retirements is expected to increase in the next 5-
10 years while the demand for services will also increase with the aging population.

<p>hours of first-year English (ENGL). * All students should take Academic Writing, unless they have 
received an Academic Writing waiver, in which case they should take first-year English. 
</p>
<p>CHEM-1111(3) Introduction to the Chemical Properties of Matter and CHEM-1112(3) Basic Principles of 
Chemical Reactivity are recommended (but not required) to keep your options open with other programs. 
CLAS-2850(3) Medical Terminology is also recommended and would reduce additional pre-requisite work 
that is required to be completed by accepted students into the program. 
NOTE: Completion of Pre-Radiation Therapy courses does not guarantee admission to Radiation 
Therapy.   
</p>
<p>Admission to 2nd YEAR of Radiation Therapy – CCMB Diploma Component 
</p>
<p>Students must apply for admission to the Radiation Therapy ( R T ) program by March 1st of the year in 
which their Pre-Radiation Therapy requirements are to be completed.   Manitoba students apply through 
UW innipeg and completed applications are forwarded to the CCMB Selection Committee.   
NOTE:  Eight or fewer students are accepted into the 2nd year of Radiation Therapy each year. 
</p>
<p>CCMB-RT Specific Programming is scheduled in blocks of time over three academic years. These 
components are offered in dedicated classroom space adjacent to CCMB’s main site located by Health 
Sciences Centre. Through clinical education students become proficient in the operation of linear 
accelerators, CT simulators, and other equipment used in providing radiation therapy services. Clinical 
placements in the final year of the program include mandatory attendance at the Western Manitoba 
Cancer Centre in Brandon. For details, students should refer to the School of Radiation Therapy website: 
http://www.cancercare.mb.ca/home/health_care_professionals/school_radiation_therapy/.  
</p>
<p>After successful completion of CCMB-RT programming, students receive a diploma from CCMB/UWinnipeg.   
Students can concurrently pursue the 4-year BSc in Radiation Therapy at UWinnipeg by completing the final 
required courses and electives (36 credit hours).  See the Academic Calendar for specific courses.
