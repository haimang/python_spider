<p>ANTHROPOLOGY 
</p>
<p>An thropo logy is the study of humankind , our nature as b io log ical , cu ltural , and social beings,  
and the changes in our ways of life from earliest times to the present day. 
</p>
<p>Well-known anthropologists include Margaret Mead, famous for her work in Samoan and New Guinea 
cultures, and Jane Goodall, who has made significant discoveries about primate societies. If you are 
interested in human biological evolution, in ancient societies, or in the diversity of peoples, cultures and 
languages in the contemporary world, anthropology is a good area of study for you. 
</p>
<p>At The University of Winnipeg, you can concentrate on cu ltural anthropo logy, l ingu istics, 
archaeo logy, or b io log ical anthropo logy–or you may choose an integrated program that includes all 
four areas. Practical experience is available through field schools as well as hands-on methods courses.  
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree (3-year , 4-year, or Honours).
