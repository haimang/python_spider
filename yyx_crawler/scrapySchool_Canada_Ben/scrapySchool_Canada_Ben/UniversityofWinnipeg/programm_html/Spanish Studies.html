<p>In the world today, there are 406 million native Spanish speakers, outnumbering any other language group 
except Mandarin. It is the second language in international communication, after English. There are also 60 
million speakers of Spanish as a second language and 20 million students learning it as a foreign language.  
</p>
<p>In Spanish Studies, you will learn the language, as well as gain the cultural awareness and understanding 
needed in today’s global community.  Our program offers a variety of relevant, up-to-date courses. You will 
discuss current events, issues and trends in the contemporary Hispanic world, explore the social and 
political history of Latin America through its short stories, translate newspaper articles and other texts, learn 
about the customs and traditions of Spanish speaking world, or read Don Quijote - the first modern novel of 
Western literature. 
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree (3-year) with a Major in Spanish Studies. 
</p>
<p>Students taking an undergraduate degree in another Major may choose to add a Minor in Spanish Studies 
as a secondary area of interest. The Department also participates in the Interdepartmental Minor in 
Comparative Literature.

will increase in international business, trade and law, tourism, immigration and the foreign service, global, 
national and community development with both governmental and non-governmental organizations as well
