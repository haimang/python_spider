<p>Conflict Resolution Studies is a joint program offered through the cooperation of The University of Winnipeg 
and Menno Simons College, which is located on the University campus. Conflict Resolution Studies 
prepares students to understand and interact constructively in response to personal, local, and global 
conflict situations. Topics include violence, power, justice, peace, communication, and dispute resolution.  
</p>
<p>Conflict Resolution Studies is an interdisciplinary program that allows you to customize your university 
education to fit your educational and career goals. A Major in Conflict Resolution Studies can be combined 
with a Major in another area of study such as Psychology, Business, Politics, Religious Studies, Sociology, 
Criminal Justice, or International Development Studies.

program. Students volunteer in a supervised work placement within the structure of a local, national, or 
international organization and gain practical work experience related to their program of study.
