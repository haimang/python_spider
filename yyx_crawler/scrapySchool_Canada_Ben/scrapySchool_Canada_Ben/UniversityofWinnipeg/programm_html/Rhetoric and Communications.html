<p>Majoring in Rhetoric and Communications will help you become a highly adaptable communicator with 
superb hands-on skills in drafting, revising, and editing. You will also acquire the theoretical and analytical 
background to prepare, adapt, interpret, and evaluate messages intended for a wide range of audiences and 
purposes. In short, Rhetoric and Communications will help you become a “reflective practitioner” - a 
discerning critic and crafter of language.

<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree (3-year, 4-year, or Honours). 
</p>
<p>NOTE:  The BA Honours in Rhetoric is a new offering, starting in 2019-20.

<p>Students taking an undergraduate degree in another Major may choose to add a Minor in Rhetoric and 
Communications as a secondary area of interest.

<p>“My training in Rhetoric and Communications helped me learn quickly how to read and write in law 
school.  I knew how to cut to what’s important - a crucial skill when your assigned reading for the 
week is more than you can physically carry.  I would definitely recommend the Major to those 
thinking of pursuing law.”
