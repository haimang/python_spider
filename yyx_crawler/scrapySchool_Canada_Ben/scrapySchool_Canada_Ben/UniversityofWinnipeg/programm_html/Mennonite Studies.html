<p>MENNONITE STUDIES 
</p>
<p>Mennon ite Stud ies is an in terd iscip l inary program that exp lores the h istory, social relat ions, 
rel ig ious ideals, and cu lture of the Mennon ites.   
</p>
<p>This program offers students an opportunity to study the rich heritage of the Mennonites and their 
contribution to society. Through small courses and seminars, students will explore the past and present 
culture of the Mennonites, especially their deeply-rooted commitment to peace and non-violence. The 
question of how the Mennonites evolved from the radical 16th century Anabaptists to a globalized people 
seeking peace, community and justice is a major part of the program. 
</p>
<p>By creating a flexible major in Mennonite Studies, this program leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree (3-
year). Students taking an undergraduate degree in another Major may choose to add a Minor in Mennonite 
Studies as a secondary area of interest.  To create a flexible major, contact Dr. Royden Loewen, Chair in 
Mennonite Studies at r.loewen@uwinnipeg.ca. 
</p>
<p>It is also possible to earn a Master of Arts with a focus on Mennonite History. Prospective students are 
encouraged to apply to the Joint Master Program in History through the University of Winnipeg and apply for 
one of the two graduate fellowships in the history of Mennonite culture and society.   
</p>
