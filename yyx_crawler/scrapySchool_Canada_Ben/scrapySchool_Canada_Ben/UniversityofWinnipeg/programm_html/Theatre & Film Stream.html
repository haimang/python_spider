<p>Theatre creates a world apart from us, but one so captivating that it easily draws us in.  It takes many people 
to produce this world: playwrights, actors, dancers, singers, costume and set designers, lighting specialists, 
directors, stage managers, and theatre technicians. UWinnipeg’s Department of Theatre and Film offers 
courses covering all of these areas, as well as dramatic literature, theatre history, and dramatic theory. 
</p>
<p>Our Filmmaking program gives students a solid theoretical foundation and extensive hands-on training in 
film.  Practical courses cover all aspects from writing and directing through to shooting and editing.  In 
addition, students learn the theory and history of film giving context and balance to their studies.   
</p>
<p>Many of our courses have a strong practical component. You will have the opportunity to participate in our 
annual Theatre Season (three to six productions) and in our student Film Festival.  
</p>
<p>The Department of Theatre and Film at UWinnipeg is one of the largest and most popular of its kind in the 
country.  Our professors are highly respected, award-winning professionals who are experienced teachers 
and remain active in their disciplines, bringing relevant and up-to-date instruction to our students and 
actively connecting them to the profession.  
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree (3-year or 4 year Honours) with a Major in Theatre and 
Film. Students taking an undergraduate degree in another Major may choose to add a Minor in Theatre and 
</p>
<p>Film as a secondary area of interest.   Also, please see related fact sheet on “Dance.”

university or professional school.

<p>SAMPLE COURSES 
</p>
<p>Introduction to Theatre: Performance is primarily an introduction to acting, though it includes the study of 
plays and other aspects of theatre. Designed to accommodate both students with some previous acting 
experience and those with none, the course begins with very simple improvisational exercises and gradually 
moves to more advanced work, including acting in two scenes. 
</p>
<p>Introduction to Theatre: General provides a general introduction to theatre study, including an overview of 
the components of theatrical performance and the rehearsal process, a discussion of the problems of play 
interpretation in a production context, and an introduction to theatre criticism. Students are required to attend 
several plays in Winnipeg during the current season, and these are discussed in class. 
</p>
<p>Introduction to Film examines various aspects of film: aesthetic, theoretical, critical, and practical. Through 
lectures, screenings, discussion, and practical filmmaking, students learn the basic grammar of film and
