<p>The Human Rights program - offered through the Global College - provides you with the opportunity to 
structure your education around the study of social justice, global citizenship, and human rights. Because 
'human rights’ is understood in multiple ways, this major takes an interdisciplinary approach to its core 
courses. 
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree (3-year or 4-year) with a Major in Human Rights.   
Students taking an undergraduate degree in another Major may choose to add a Minor in Human Rights as 
a secondary area of interest. This is the only undergraduate Human Rights program in Western Canada and 
is studied as a model by other institutions world-wide seeking to implement such an undergraduate degree. 
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS

<p>You will develop knowledge and analytic skills relevant to a wide range of jobs in both the public and private 
sector, such as in public administration, international rights and advocacy groups, humanitarian and refugee 
organizations, and academia.  A major in Human Rights is an excellent background for law school and for 
work in NGOs and other rewarding fields. A minor in Human Rights is a strong and relevant supplement for 
students pursuing careers in business or the health sciences.

<p>SAMPLE COURSES 
</p>
<p>Introduction to Global Citizenship traces the historical development of the idea of "global citizenship," 
interrogating the meanings, contradictions and contentions associated with this term. Through guest 
speakers and student research on specific issues and injustices that are present in Manitoba communities, 
and which also have global connections or manifestations, students examine current practices aimed at 
fostering global citizenship. 
</p>
<p>Emerging Issues in Human Rights is designed to introduce students, in a range of disciplines and 
students entering university, to challenges and opportunities in global to local human rights, by cultivating 
foundational skills for academic success. In both classroom and community settings, students explore global 
issues using the city as our human rights 'campus' through current news items, literature, and social analysis 
from diverse perspectives, shaped by research expertise in Global College. 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Institutions analyzes the role of specialized Canadian and international human rights 
institutions, such as human rights commissions and tribunals. It provides an understanding of the legislative 
frameworks for select institutions and procedures for accessing selected human rights institutions, and 
assesses the societal impact of such commissions and tribunals through their educational functions as well 
as case decisions.
