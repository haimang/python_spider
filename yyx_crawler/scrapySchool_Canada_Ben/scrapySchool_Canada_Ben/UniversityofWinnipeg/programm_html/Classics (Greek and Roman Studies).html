</p>
<p>CLASSICS 
</p>
<p>Classics is the study of ancient Greek and Roman cu lture – a h istory intertw ined w ith the 
h istory of the world. 
</p>
<p>Democracy began in Greece. The Roman Empire rose and fell. There were extraordinary and enduring 
achievements in art, literature, and philosophy. All this is highlighted by the legacies of great writers such as 
Plato, Sophocles, Virgil, and Cicero. Classics’ influence can be found in today’s religions, movies, literature, 
politics, journalism, and advertising, and continues to be a source of creative inspiration for writers, artists, 
filmmakers, and software designers across the globe. If you have a desire to understand our modern world, 
studying Classical civilization is an ideal way to begin; ancient Greek and Latin form the basis of over 60% of 
English words, so if you want to improve your ability to communicate precisely and gain access to thousands 
of years of literature, Classical Languages is a perfect way to start. 
In the Classics program, you may choose to concentrate on classical civilization or study the classical 
languages. Classics is also an ideal supplement to other programs of study. Since they offer an 
interdisciplinary approach to the study of an interesting and influential culture, courses in this program 
provide an exceptional background not only for study at the graduate level in many areas besides Classics, 
but also for many careers requiring concise communication and critical thinking skills. 
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree (3-year, 4-year, or Honours, special iz ing in either 
C lass ica l C iv i l izat ion or C lass ica l Languages) with a Major in Classics. Students taking an 
</p>
<p>undergraduate degree in another Major may choose to add a Minor in Classics as a secondary area of 
interest. 
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>Graduates of Classics find rewarding careers in museums, tourism, writing, or publishing. Others are 
employed in the civil service or teaching at the high school level. Many courses in Classics provide excellent 
background for professions such as advertising, marketing, medicine, law, project management, theology, 
and in various levels and areas of education, ranging from ancient history, philosophy, through to social 
history. Classics majors have even gone on to be physicists and intelligence officers, or have founded 
technology companies.

<p> “The faculty here gave me a lot of individual attention and even allowed me to 
work on research projects with them. That kind of in-depth training is hard to find 
at larger schools and graduate institutions.”
