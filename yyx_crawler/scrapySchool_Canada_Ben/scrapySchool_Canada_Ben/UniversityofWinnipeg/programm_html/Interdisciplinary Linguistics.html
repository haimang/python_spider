<p>INTERDISCIPLINARY LINGUISTICS 
</p>
<p>The study of L ingu istics at The Un ivers ity of W inn ipeg considers the relationsh ip between 
language, cu l ture and commun ication . 
</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary Linguistics examines the complexities of language use in daily communication in various 
social and cultural contexts. In this program, you will explore language structure and cultural context across 
a variety of university departments. 
</p>
<p>A better understanding of how language encodes meaning will help you to write, read and speak with 
greater confidence, fluency, and power. A better understanding of how the cultural context influences and is 
influenced by linguistic choices will enable you to extend your range of, and success with, subtle forms of 
expression.

<p>“The Linguistics Program gave me the tools to analyze communication in a practical way. 
Its interdisciplinary nature helped me develop a broader perspective on what language is 
and how it is connected to all facets of our lives.  This led me to pursue Speech-Language 
Pathology, a profession that allows me to apply my linguistic knowledge to clinical 
populations, ultimately to improve their quality of life.”
