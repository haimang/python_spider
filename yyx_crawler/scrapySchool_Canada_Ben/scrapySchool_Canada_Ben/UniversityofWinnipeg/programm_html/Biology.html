<p>BIOLOGY 
</p>
<p>B io logy is the study of any form of l ife, from the DNA mo lecu le to the interact ions of organ isms 
w ithin the various ecosystems of the earth . 
</p>
<p>Biology is a broad discipline, which includes the subject areas of botany, zoology, microbiology, cell biology, 
ecology, and genetics. It examines all life forms from the simple to the complex, and is an ideal partner to 
study in chemistry, physics, and mathematics. If you have an aptitude for science and possess a keen 
desire to understand the living world, you will find the study of biology very rewarding.  
</p>
<p>At The University of Winnipeg, we teach a wide range of courses and offer active research programs in 
botany ecology, forest ecology, mosquito biology, evolutionary genetics, molecular biology, evolutionary 
physiology, soil microbiology and remediation, limnology, bioinformatics, genomics, dendrochronology, 
behavioural biology of birds, effects of UV radiation on the environment, and cell biology.  
</p>
<p>Biology can be explored in several different programs of study at The University of Winnipeg which can lead 
</p>
<p>to a Bachelor of Science degree  (3-year, 4-year, or Honours). 
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>Graduates work in government laboratories, university research laboratories, scientific consulting 
organizations, pharmaceutical companies, conservation and wildlife management, and the scientific 
</p>
<p>publishing industry. Graduates may apply to enter dental, medical, veterinary science, and education 
</p>
<p>faculties. Those who have obtained the 4-year B.Sc. or Honours B.Sc. are well prepared to enter graduate 
programs, ultimately leading to careers as scientists.

<p>NOTE: This sample first year is representative of the courses you may take. For many of our programs, you 
may choose another set of courses and still be well on your way to a degree. Also, for most programs you 
do not have to take 30 credit hours (five full courses) in your first year.

<p>“I credit a lot of my success to the personal attention and research opportunities available 
at The University of Winnipeg.  Because this is a university with an undergraduate focus, 
professors are very accessible to undergraduate students.”
