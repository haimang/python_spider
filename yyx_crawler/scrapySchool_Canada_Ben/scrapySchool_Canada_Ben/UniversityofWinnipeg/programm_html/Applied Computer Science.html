<p>FACULTY OF SC IENCE 
</p>
<p>APPLIED COMPUTER SCIENCE 
</p>
<p>The App l ied Computer Sc ience program focuses on the theory and app l ication of comput ing in 
business and scientific environments.  
</p>
<p>The Applied Computer Science major is designed to prepare students in the following core areas: 
</p>
<p> Programming Fundamentals (object-oriented, event driven, algorithms) 
 
Information Management (database systems, data modeling/warehousing, relational databases) 
 Software Engineering (software requirements, design, process and project management) 
 Operating Systems 
 Net-Centric Computing (internet programming, networks, security) 
 Human Computer Interaction (GUI Design and Programming) 
 
Intelligent Systems (Machine Learning).  
</p>
<p>Our team-oriented courses are meant to strengthen communication skills, experience group dynamics, and 
foster self-confidence. The 4-year major includes the development of a team-based software project for a 
local IT organization. Our program will help develop analytical thinking and applied skills by blending 
theoretical and practical aspects of computer science.  
</p>
<p>The program can lead to a Bachelor of Science (3-year, 4-year, or Honours) or a Bachelor of Arts (3-
</p>
<p>year or 4-year).  There are 4 streams:  Applied Computer Science, Information Systems, Health Informatics, 
and Scientific Computing.   
</p>
<p>Students taking an undergraduate degree in another Major may choose to add a Minor in ACS as a 
secondary area of interest. The department also offers a Masters degree - see separate fact sheet. 
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>Graduates are employed in a wide variety of positions in business, industry, and government in the areas of 
web application development, database application programming, database administration, systems 
analysis and design, project management, technical support, and quality assurance. Some pursue graduate 
studies in computer science, information sciences, biostatistics, or MBA programs.
