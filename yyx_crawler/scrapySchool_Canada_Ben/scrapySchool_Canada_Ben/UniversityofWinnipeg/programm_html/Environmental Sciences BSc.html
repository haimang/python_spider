may choose another set of courses and still be well on your way to a degree. Also, for most programs you 
do not have to take 30 credit hours (five full courses) in your first year. 
NATIONAL ACCREDITATION: BSc degrees in Environmental Science at UWinnipeg have been accredited 
by the Canadian Environmental Accreditation Commission (CEAC) and Environmental Careers Organization 
(ECO) Canada, demonstrating our national standard of quality.  Both Forestry-related streams have also 
been accredited by the prestigious Canadian Institute of Forestry (CIF).

<p>“My experience with the Forest Ecology program was wonderful.  It’s small enough that professors 
and students can get to know each other well, yet it also offers a lot of opportunities for students to 
find out what interests them and to pursue those interests.  I was able to take field courses, work for 
two summers as a research assistant, and even participate in academic conferences.”
