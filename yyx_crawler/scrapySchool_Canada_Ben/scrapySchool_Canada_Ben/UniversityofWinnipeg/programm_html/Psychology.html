<p>PSYCHOLOGY 
</p>
<p>Psycho logy is the scient if ic study of the m ind , human experience, and behaviour, rang ing from 
the basic mechan isms of the nervous system to princip les govern ing social relations.   
</p>
<p>Psychology seeks to understand scientifically such diverse topics as aggression, attachment between 
infants and caregivers, reading, psychological disorders, romantic relationships, and effective behaviour in 
organizations. These and other topics are examined from multiple perspectives, including basic biological 
processes, early environment, the impact of poverty and other stressors, social context, and culture. 
</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to select courses from various areas that make up its core:  physiological 
psychology, perception, learning, cognition, developmental psychology, personality, social psychology, and 
abnormal psychology.  Students also take courses on the scientific methods that psychologists use to 
understand human behaviour and experience, from observations and surveys to biological procedures. 
Outside of class, students have opportunities to participate in psychological research, to work with faculty on 
specific research projects, and to attend interesting talks.  
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree (3-year, 4-year, or Honours). The 4-year Honours 
</p>
<p>degree is recommended for anyone planning to go on to graduate studies in the field.  
</p>
<p>Also, please see related fact sheet on “Biopsychology.”

<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>A background in Psychology is useful in most workplaces, as knowledge about motivation, perception, 
learning, social behavior and data analysis can be applied on a regular basis.  Psychology courses are often 
part of training programs or are prerequisites for degrees in areas such as nursing or medicine, education, 
speech pathology, law enforcement, social services, business, and public administration.  The 4-year 
Honours degree in Psychology provides excellent preparation for graduate programs, which can lead to 
careers in research, academia or clinical practice.

<p>NOTE: This sample first year is only representative of courses students might take. For many programs, 
students may choose an alternative set of courses and still be well on their way to a degree. Also, most 
programs do not require that students take 30 credit hours (five full courses) in first year.

<p>The University of Winnipeg Psychology Department is a program that punches well above 
its weight. After finishing my BA Honours in Psychology I was accepted to the PhD 
Psychology program at the University College London which is the best Psychology 
program in Europe. I believe what gave me a competitive application was the rigorous 
approach to training us in research methods as well as fostering in us a deep sense of 
curiosity so that we never stop learning. Even now that I run a Human Factors Lab for 
Gamin International, I still find that the training I had in statistics and quantitative research 
methods is invaluable on a day to day basis.
