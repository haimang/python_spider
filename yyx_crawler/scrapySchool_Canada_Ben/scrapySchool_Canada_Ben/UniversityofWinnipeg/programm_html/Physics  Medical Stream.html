<p>MEDICAL PHYSICS 
</p>
<p>Clin ical Med ical and Health Physics is an excit ing and expand ing f ield that app l ies our 
fundamental know ledge of physics to the prevent ion , d iagnosis and treatmen t of a variety of 
human cond it ions.  
</p>
<p>Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance, Computed Tomography, Nuclear Medicine, X-rays, Radiation Therapy, 
are all branches of medical physics in which continued research is being conducted by a very large group of 
dedicated researchers consisting of highly qualified physicists, engineers and radiologists.  
</p>
<p>The program at UWinnipeg leads to a Bachelor of Science 4-year Honours and provides excellent 
preparation for entry into a graduate program, such as the two-year MSc program at the University of 
Manitoba through the Division of Medical Physics at CancerCare Manitoba. (Currently, the recommended 
training for medical physicists is a degree at the graduate level.) 
</p>
<p>Many graduates go on to become members of the Canadian College of Physicists in Medicine (CCPM) by 
passing written examinations. CCPM certification is becoming widely accepted in Canada and other 
countries and is often required at senior levels in medical physics.  
</p>

</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>Most medical physicists work in hospital diagnostic imaging departments, cancer treatment facilities, or 
hospital-based research establishments, while others work in universities, government, and industry.  Here 
are a few examples of specific positions:  clinical medical physicist; radiation safety officer for medical 
radioisotope facilities; radiotherapy physicist who helps design/construct radiotherapy treatment equipment 
or who researches the use of heat and lasers in cancer treatment.  
</p>
<p>SAMPLE COURSES 
</p>
<p>Human Anatomy and Physiology: This course deals with the biological study of the human organism; 
microscopic and gross anatomy; cellular and general physiology, and human genetics. 
</p>
<p>Foundations of Physics I: This calculus-based course provides students with a working knowledge of the 
basic concepts underlying modern physics. 
</p>
<p>Medical Imaging: This course is an introduction to medical imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, x-rays, 
CT scans, MRIs, and PET scans. 
</p>
<p>Medical Physics and Physiological Measurement: This course will introduce the core subject areas of 
Medical Physics, in particular the physics of physiology and of radiology.

<p>NOTE: This sample first year is representative of the courses you may take. For many of our programs, you 
may choose another set of courses and still be well on your way to a degree. Also, for most programs you 
do not have to take 30 credit hours (five full courses) in your first year.

<p>"I was fortunate to have the opportunity to explore medical physics research at the 
University of Winnipeg. The interdisciplinary nature of this branch of physics exposed me 
to advanced topics in electromagnetism, math and computer science, while also learning 
how technology such as MRI can improve our lives from a medical perspective. The 
excellent professors, and the breadth of their combined research experiences, meant I was 
always discovering new ideas and developing new skills outside of normal coursework."
