anatomical, physiological, behavioural, and developmental approaches. The core program has required 
elements in Biology, Chemistry, and Psychology. As a student of Biopsychology, you will gain an 
understanding of comparative anatomy, cellular biology, and human behaviour. Throughout your studies, 
you will obtain experience in up-to-date laboratory techniques and procedures. 
</p>
<p>The Biopsychology program offers you the option of combining two exciting disciplines to create a skill set 
that is interesting and unique. It is designed to appeal to people interested in careers in neuroscience, 
psychology, medicine, speech pathology, communication disorders, and related fields.  
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Science degree  (3-year, 4-year, or 4-year Honours).
