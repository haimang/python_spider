<p>ECONOMICS 
</p>
<p>Econom ics is the study of how cho ices made by ind ividua ls , bus iness f irms , governments , and 
other organ izations determine the way a society’s resources are used .    
</p>
<p>Whether you’re in the boardroom or in the office, the study of economics can make a difference. Economics 
will help you understand how economies work, how people further their goals, and how governments and 
businesses make decisions.   
</p>
<p>An economics degree will provide you with more than an understanding of how markets and economies 
function; it will provide you with insight into a number of questions involving politics, law, history, 
environment, development and resource use. The world is changing, the demands of employers are 
changing and challenges that were once local are now global.  
</p>
<p>At The University of Winnipeg, an Economics degree means getting ready for the future, offering students a 
range of flexible skills that helps them to grow.   
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree (3-year, 4-year, or Honours) w ith a Major in 
</p>
<p>Econom ics.   Students tak ing an undergraduate degree in another Ma jor may choose to add a M inor 
in Econom ics as a secondary area of interest.
