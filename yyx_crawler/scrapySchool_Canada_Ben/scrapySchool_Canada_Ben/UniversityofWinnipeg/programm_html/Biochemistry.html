</p>
<p>Biochemistry is the chemistry of life. It includes the structure and function of biologically important 
molecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids like DNA, carbohydrates, lipids, and many smaller biologically-
active chemicals. Biochemistry graduates work in many different fields. These include research on the 
molecular basis of diseases, development of pesticides and medical diagnostics, forensics, immunology, 
environmental remediation, and physiology. Throughout this program (formerly known as Molecular Biology) 
important developments in the field are highlighted and future directions explored. 
</p>
<p>At The University of Winnipeg, Biochemistry is an interdisciplinary program. Most required courses are 
taught in the Departments of Biology and Chemistry. Students also take relevant courses in Physics, 
Mathematics, and Statistics along with elective courses. You will learn about the chemical make-up of cells, 
the regulation of metabolism, and the actions and control of genes. In addition, you will become familiar with 
the laboratory techniques used in this large area of science.  
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bache lor of Sc ience (3-year, 4-year, or Honours) .  Also , p lease see related

<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>Career opportunities for graduates of this program lie in life science-oriented industries such as food 
technology, pest control, and the design and manufacture of pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. Graduates 
may work in government labs or a variety of private industries. A bachelor’s degree in biochemistry may 
</p>
<p>qualify you to enter medicine, dentistry, or pharmacy. It may also provide the foundation for further 
</p>
<p>research and study at the graduate level.
