</p>
<p>Disability Studies will challenge you to think about “disability” and “ability” in a new way. Using a social 
model lens, the problem becomes a lack of ramps rather than the fact that someone uses a wheelchair. In 
this program students will begin from an examination and critique of the bio-medical model of disability. 
</p>
<p>Topics to be considered include human rights, ethics and accountability, adaptive physical activity, sport and 
recreation, social movements, normalcy, eugenics, genetic engineering, family, sexuality, employment, 
socialization and development, aging, education, adaptive and universal design, and gender issues.  
</p>
<p>This is a joint program with Red River College and leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree (3-year, 4-year, 
</p>

<p>Theorizing Disability Prior to the 1970s, the concept of disability was centred on individual impairments 
and people with disabilities were "othered" because of their difference from ableist norms. Over the last 
three decades, disability activists and theorists have sought to shift the focus from a medical model to a 
social model. Within the social model, external obstacles are regarded as disabling, rather than non-
conformist bodies. This move has had a powerful impact on a disability theorization and political action. The 
social model of disability has much in common with critical analyses that deconstruct and denaturalize race

<p>and  gender. In this course, we will consider the implications of the social model of theorizing disability, 
examine the critiques, and explore the alternatives. 
</p>
<p>Disabilities, Sexualities, and Rights Links between living and disabilities and risk of disadvantage or 
discrimination  are clear, yet focus on equality, employment access, services, and physical health needs 
may render invisible or subjugate issues of sexual health, identity, and expression of people with disabilities. 
Taught from critical disability, feminist, and queer perspectives, this course embraces social models and 
explores human rights implications of challenging bio-medical views of sexualities and disabilities, focusing 
on how people with disabilities themselves embrace their sexualities and/or are prevented from doing so. 
Recognising and balancing complex and sometimes apparently competing self-identities and needs is 
integral from a human rights perspective.
