<p>STATISTICS 
</p>
<p>Statistics deals w ith the co llection , ana lysis, presentat ion , and interpretat ion of numerical data. 
</p>
<p>Today’s society is awash in information and data; the Internet has the capacity to flood us with raw 
information. Politicians, interest groups, and the media constantly cite numbers, ratios, and percentages to 
bolster points of view. Whose numbers can we believe? Does a certain pesticide cause cancer? Is the 
economy really up? Is that new medical treatment really effective? Statistics offers the tools to answer these 
kinds of questions. It has an almost limitless scope of application. 
</p>
<p>Many people use statistics poorly. Our courses in statistics and probability theory give students the 
background to use statistics carefully and correctly, with integrity and confidence. Theoretical courses stress 
the logical development of statistical methods, while our applied courses focus on the application of 
statistical methods to interpreting numerical data. Since computer programs are required in the analysis of 
large data sets, students will find it useful to study statistical computing and programming. 
</p>
<p>This program leads to either a Bachelor of Science degree (3-year or 4-year) or a Bachelor of Arts 
</p>
<p>degree (3-year or 4-year) with a Major in Statistics.  Students taking a degree in another Major may choose 
to enhance their degree by adding a Minor in Statistics as a secondary area of interest.  
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>Graduates apply their expertise in agricultural research, health care research, quality control and actuarial 
work.  They work with specialists such as economists, biologists, chemists, and doctors to assist in the 
design of experiments and sampling plans and the analysis of research data. The majority of statisticians 
find employment with private corporations or government departments and agencies. Statistics Canada 
representatives visit our campus regularly looking for statistics graduates to fill highly desirable jobs.

<p>NOTE: This sample first year is representative of the courses you may take. For many of our programs, you 
may choose another set of courses and still be well on your way to a degree. Also, for most programs you 
do not have to take 30 credit hours (five full courses) in your first year.

<p>“I’ve had so much encouragement from my professors. I think there is an effort to 
encourage women in mathematics and science, which is important. The message 
has been that I can do anything I put my mind to.”

<p>REQUIRED HIGH SCHOOL COURSES 
</p>
<p>Students must meet The University of Winnipeg’s general admission requirements, and must also have Pre-
