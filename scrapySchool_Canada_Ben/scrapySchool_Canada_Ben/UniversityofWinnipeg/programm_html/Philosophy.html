<p>PHILOSOPHY 
</p>
<p>Ph i losophy is the use of reason and d ialogue to understand and try to answ er questions that 
are common to al l human beings about what is of va lue, what is real , and what we can know . 
</p>
<p>Philosophy is concerned with questions that any person, at any time or place, can wonder about and seek to 
answer. Such questions include: Can we prove that God exists? What is justice? What is the best life for 
me? How can I know when I am right and when I am mistaken? Where do my ideas come from?  
</p>
<p>The Philosophy Department at The University of Winnipeg has had a long and successful commitment, 
distinctive among Manitoba’s universities, to teaching philosophy historically. Students read texts by authors 
from every period in the history of philosophy and from many parts of the world. This allows students to 
consider a wide range of answers to philosophical questions as well as to understand the origins of the 
ideas that influence our thinking about ourselves and our society today.  
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree (3-year, 4-year, or Honours) with a Major in Philosophy. 
</p>
<p>Students taking an undergraduate degree in another Major may choose to add a Minor in Philosophy as a 
secondary area of interest. 
</p>

<p>Our graduates’ abilities to analyze complex questions, construct arguments and debate issues are useful in 
all walks of life. These skills are very highly regarded in the fields of education, journalism, research, 
government, administration, counselling, policy-making, business, and law.  Philosophy students have a 
strong track record of being accepted into prestigious graduate schools in Canada and abroad, as well as

<p>“Happiness for me is growing in as many ways as I can, and the time I’ve spent at this University has 
allowed me to flourish academically and personally. I have the faculty to thank for that–they have 
been caring and professional. The close relationships I have formed are crucial to who and where I 
am now.”
