</p>
<p>PHYSICS 
</p>
<p>Physics is the quest to understand al l natural phenomena using scient if ic methods.  
</p>
<p>Research in physics has led to revolutionary discoveries like lasers, magnetic resonance imaging, fibre optic 
communications, and transistors. These developments, and those following from fundamental physics 
research, have had, and will have, great importance upon human society in the twenty-first century.  
</p>
<p>The University of Winnipeg has a nationally recognized Physics Department, which offers an excellent 
learning atmosphere, fostered by small class sizes and individual attention from professors. Our professors’ 
research spans a broad range of topics – from subatomic physics (especially neutron and neutrino 
particles), the inner workings of the nucleus, and the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 
diagnosing disease, to the inner workings of black holes, higher-dimensional cosmology, superstrings and 
quantum gravity. Students often participate in these research activities and many find summer employment 
with the various research groups.  
</p>
<p>Students can study for their Bachelor of Science degree (3-year, 4-year, or Honours). Different 
</p>
<p>specialized streams are also available for each degree type, such as: Chemical Physics, Computational 
Physics, Medical Physics, and Mathematical Physics. I f you ’re interested in becom ing a teacher, Phys ics 
can be used as a teachab le sub ject in our Educat ion program.   
</p>
<p>Also: Please see related fact sheets on “Medical Physics” and “Radiation Health & Safety Physics.”  
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>Our program emphasizes critical thinking, decision making, and creative problem solving skills. These 
qualities have helped our graduates to secure employment in many areas, including computers, 
engineering, finance, geophysics, lasers and optics, medical physics, military applications, space science, 
teaching, and high-tech, academic, and corporate research. 
</p>
<p>SAMPLE COURSES 
</p>
<p>Foundations of Physics I is a calculus-based first-year course which provides students with a working 
knowledge of basic concepts underlying modern physics. It is primarily for Physics majors, but it is also 
useful for students interested in science. 
</p>
<p>Electricity & Magnetism is a second year course which covers circuits, magnetic effects of a current, 
electromagnetic induction, and properties of dielectric and magnetic materials. 
</p>
<p>Quantum Mechanics I is a third year course on special relativity, the wave properties of matter, and 
applications of the Schrodinger equation.

<p>NOTE: This sample first year is representative of the courses you may take. For many of our programs, you 
may choose another set of courses and still be well on your way to a degree. Also, for most programs you 
do not have to take 30 credit hours (five full courses) in your first year.

<p>“I like everything about the physics department.  The professors are incredibly talented, 
friendly, and helpful with advice for those trying to figure out what to do after graduation. 
As well, undergraduate students have many opportunities to do research.”
