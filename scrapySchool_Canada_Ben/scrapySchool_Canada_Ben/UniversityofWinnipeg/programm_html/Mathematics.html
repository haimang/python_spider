</p>
<p>MATHEMATICS 
</p>
<p>Mathematics is the science of number, form, and log ic. 
</p>
<p>Some people describe mathematics as the realm of numerical problem solving. Others see it as the study of 
functions. Still others view mathematics as the study of structures such as geometric shapes and computer 
networks. At its most fundamental level, mathematics is a way of thinking. Mathematicians are in the 
business of logical reasoning. 
</p>
<p>A typical course in modern mathematics begins with nothing more than a few definitions and a modest set of 
assumptions. From such a meagre starting point, a mathematician is trained to build a system of truths, a 
set of tools, via the rigours of logic. Some areas of mathematics can be quite abstract, such as Real 
Analysis, or can be motivated by practical applications, such as Differential Equations. 
</p>
<p>At UWinnipeg, you have flexibility in designing your course of study. There are core courses that all 
mathematics majors must take, but you will also choose from a diverse group of additional courses, in areas 
such as topology, combinatorics and graph theory. 
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Science (3-year, 4-year, or Honours) or a Bachelor of Arts (3-
</p>
<p>year or 4-year) w ith a Major in Mathematics.  If you are interested in becoming a teacher, mathematics 
can be used as a teachable major or a teachable minor in the Education program.  Students tak ing a 
degree in another ma jor may choose to add a M inor in mathemat ics as a secondary area of interest. 
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>Graduates find employment in areas related to finance, business, computers, insurance, 
telecommunications, engineering, physics, biology, or economics. A mathematics degree is a great choice 
for students destined for professional programs such as medicine, dentistry, management, or law.   
</p>
<p>SAMPLE COURSES 
</p>
<p>Discrete Mathemat ics is a f irs t-year course that introduces s tudents to mathemat ica l reason ing. In 
add it ion to tra in ing students to wr ite log ica l arguments, th is course exp lores prob lems dea l ing with 
number theory, re lat ions, funct ions, and count ing techn iques. 
</p>
<p>App l ied Algebra, a second-year course, introduces abs tract a lgebra ic structures, together wi th some 
of the ir app l icat ions to data transm iss ion, cryptography (secret codes), and exper imenta l des ign.  
</p>
<p>Group Theory is a th ird-year course that stud ies add it ion or mu lt ip l ica t ion in abstrac t structures 
known as “groups”.  Or ig ina l ly introduced to study roots of equat ions, i t is now cons idered essent ia l to 
the understand ing of a lgebra, crysta l lography, and quan tum mechan ics.

<p>NOTE: This sample first year is representative of the courses you may take. For many of our programs, you 
may choose another set of courses and still be well on your way to a degree. Also, for most programs you 
do not have to take 30 credit hours (five full courses) in your first year.

<p>“The faculty at UWinnipeg is some of the best in the country, and I also had a lot of opportunities to 
do research starting early in my degree, which is uncommon at larger universities.”

<p>REQUIRED HIGH SCHOOL COURSES 
</p>
<p>In addition to meeting the University of Winnipeg’s general admission requirements, you must have Pre-
</p>
<p>Calculus Mathematics 40S. Students who are lacking the prerequisite Pre-Calculus Mathematics 40S 
should enroll in MATH-0041 AND MATH 0042, Mathematical Access I and II which together serve as a 
</p>
<p>prerequisite replacement for Pre-Calculus Mathematics 40S.
