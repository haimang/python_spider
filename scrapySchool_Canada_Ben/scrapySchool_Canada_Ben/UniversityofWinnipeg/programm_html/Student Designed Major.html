program of study that is both personally interesting and professionally relevant. With the assistance of a 
Faculty Sponsor and an Advisory Committee, you can design your own major related to a central theme or 
focus. Student-Designed Majors usually combine courses from three University departments.

<p>SAMPLE FLEXBILE (STUDENT-DESIGNED) MAJORS 
</p>
<p>Cross Cultural Communication (Departments: Anthropology, Linguistics, Modern Languages and 
Literature, and Psychology) This study of communication looks across cultural and language acquisition 
barriers and explores such issues as bilingualism, code mixing, multi-lingualism, code switching, second 
language acquisition and communicative competence. 
</p>
<p>Rhetoric, Gender and the Bible (Departments: Religious Studies, Rhetoric, Writing and Communications, 
and Women and Gender Studies) This major explores gender stereotyping through metaphors in the 
Hebrew Bible. The focus is on the gendering of apostasy - the way that biblical rhetoric frequently uses 
feminine metaphors to describe unfaithfulness to Yahweh. 
</p>
<p>Physics and Neuroscience (Departments: Chemistry, Physics, and Psychology) This major combines 
physics and neuroscience to meet medical school requirements. It provides the vocabulary and 
understanding of physics behind neuroimaging and the physiological and psychological background for 
further studies in neuroscience. 
</p>
<p>Restorative Justice (Departments: Conflict Resolution Studies, Criminal Justice, and Sociology) This major 
deals with a restorative approach as an alternative to current traditional court interventions when dealing 
with offenders in Canada. With a particular focus on policy design and implementation, the program also 
includes study of adaptive and dynamic processes of crime prevention through environmental design.   
</p>
<p>Ritual and the Performance of Identity (Departments: English, Religious Studies, and Theatre and Film) 
This major is an exploration of how cultural, religious, social, and personal rituals contribute to the 
construction of identity in both communities and individuals.

on the historical relationship between scientific paradigm shifts and major changes in political thought, 
identifying the process through which themes in science (especially physics) have been absorbed into 
political ideology. 
</p>
<p>Urban Planning and Social Justice (Departments: Geography, Politics, and Sociology) This course of 
study will investigate how physical and social urban landscapes influence each other and how can they be 
manipulated for the purpose of creating more livable and equitable cities.
