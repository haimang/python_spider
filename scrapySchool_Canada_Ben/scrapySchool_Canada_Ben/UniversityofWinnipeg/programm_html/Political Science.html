<p>POLITICAL SCIENCE 
</p>
<p>Political Science is the systematic study of power, authority and governance that helps us 
understand and engage in the important processes and institutions that structure our 
lives.  
</p>
<p>The Political Science Department offers a wide range of courses that consider such issues as: 
relations between nation-states; the movement, cooperation and interactions of groups of people across 
state borders; the interactions between state and society; the nature of power and authority; and the impact 
of such things as political parties, interest groups, social classes and other societal organizations.    
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Arts (3-year, 4-year, or Honours) with a Major in Political Science. 
We also offer a Certificate in Public Policy & Administration.   Students tak ing an undergraduate degree 
in another Ma jor may choose to add a M inor in Po l it ica l Sc ience as a secondary area of interest. 
</p>
