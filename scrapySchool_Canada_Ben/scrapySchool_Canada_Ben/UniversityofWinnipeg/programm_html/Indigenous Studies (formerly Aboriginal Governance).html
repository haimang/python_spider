<p>SAMPLE COURSES 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Ways of Knowing - This course offers an introduction to Indigenous ways of knowing through 
active participation in strategies that facilitate the production of Aboriginal knowledge and through 
comparisons with Euro-American ways of knowing. By taking part in basic ceremony and related practices, 
students gain an understanding of how First Peoples of Manitoba relate to each other, to the land, to other 
animals, and to the world. 
</p>
<p>Management and Financial Administration for Community Leadership - As small-scale and not-for-
</p>
<p>profit structures, community-based and Aboriginal organizations often face unique challenges and 
political/cultural realities in terms of overall management and operations. This course provides students with 
a good understanding of the key facets of management and administrative structures within the community 
and Aboriginal sectors in particular. 
</p>
<p>International Rights of Indigenous Peoples - This course examines current developments at the 
international level with respect to the rights of Indigenous peoples, particularly the right to self-determination.

<p>“Obtaining a BA in Indigenous Studies has helped me gain a better 
understanding of the unique relationship between Indigenous Nations of 
Canada and the Crown. With this knowledge, I am able to understand the 
true spirit and intent of our Treaties and how we are to move forward 
towards reconciliation.”
