<p>CO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAM 
</p>
<p>The Co-operat ive Education Program takes you beyond the classroom as it prepares you for 
paid work experience in a relevant field . 
</p>
<p>Co-op education combines in-class learning with the opportunity to gain valuable paid employment in your 
chosen field.  Co-op students complete a non-credit course in pre-employment skills, workshops and 
networking opportunities as well as meet with the Co-op Coordinator to discuss their career goals.  You’ll be 
assisted in applying for a co-op work term from positions posted by prospective employers.  Although there 
is no guarantee of a job, the program has been successful in attracting interesting companies looking to hire 
a co-op student. 
</p>
<p>The University of Winnipeg's Co-operative Education Program is open to students from the Departments of 
Applied Computer Science, Business, and Economics. Students from other departments are welcome to 
apply and will be reviewed on a case by case analysis.   Work terms are typically four months in duration 
and may begin in January, May or September.  You will work in a professional environment, using the 
knowledge and skills that you learned in the classroom.   This work experience will add to your resume as 
well as make you aware of different career options within your field.  If you choose the for-credit option, you 
can also earn three general elective credit hours towards your degree.
</p>
<p>When you complete a work term through the University’s Co-op Program, it appears on your transcript, 
whether you choose the for-credit option or the not-for-credit option. When you complete three work terms, 
you will receive a Co-operative Education Designation on your degree when you graduate.
