such as phonetics, morphology, syntax, lexicology and dialectology, and literature courses examining the 
major movements, periods and genres in the literatures of France and Canada.  All courses encourage 
students to develop clarity and diversity of thought, intellectual rigour, and method.

<p>A command of both of Canada’s official languages is a definite asset in obtaining employment in almost 
every field. Students who graduate with a degree in French Studies can go on to teach or to become 
translators or interpreters. 
</p>
<p>Careers in administration, government, industry, commerce, publishing, and journalism are among those 
favoured by French Studies graduates. In addition, speaking one or more languages is beneficial for careers 
in museums, libraries, travel, tourism, and companies having overseas offices.

<p>Elementary French 1 is designed for students with no prior training in French.  Basic skills in oral
