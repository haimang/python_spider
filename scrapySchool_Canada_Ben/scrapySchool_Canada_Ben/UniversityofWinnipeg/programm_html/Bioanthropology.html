<p>B ioanthropo logy is a un ique program that comb ines aspects of anthropo logy w ith the 
b io log ical and physical sc iences. It is designed to exam ine human b io log ical systems of the 
past and present.  
</p>
<p>This program combines the information and methodologies of anatomy, physical anthropology, archaeology, 
biochemistry, and biology with the techniques of the physical sciences to examine human biological systems 
of the past and present. The core program has required elements in biology, chemistry, and anthropology. 
You’ll gain an understanding of comparative anatomy, cellular biology, and methods in human and primate 
evolution and archaeology, and obtain experience in up-to-date laboratory techniques and procedures. 
</p>
<p>The Bioanthropology program offers you the option of combining two exciting disciplines to create a skill set 
that is interesting and unique. It is designed to appeal to people interested in human biology as well as those 
going on to professional programs in medicine and dentistry. Graduates with a 4-year degree may also 
pursue graduate studies in anthropology or biology. 
</p>
<p>Bioanthropology is an interdisciplinary program that allows you to customize your university education to fit 
your educational and career goals by taking courses from a number of different disciplines or areas. This 
program is founded primarily on courses from the departments of Anthropology, Biology, and Chemistry. 
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Science degree (3-year, 4-year) . 
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>Employment opportunities for Bioanthropology graduates exist in government and hospital laboratories, 
forensic laboratories, museums, and zoos. This program also provides a basis for entry into professional 
programs in dentistry and medicine, and to graduate programs in anthropology and biology for students who 
take the four-year degree option.
