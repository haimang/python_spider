<p>RADIATION HEALTH AND SAFETY  
</p>
<p>Th is program, offered through the Phys ics Department, prov ides students wi th both the theoret ica l 
and pract ica l sk i l l sets to ma inta in current rad iat ion safe ty standards in the energy, secur ity and hea lth

<p>It is anticipated that Canada, along with many other nations, will soon face a critical shortage of 
appropriately trained people in this area.  The goal of this 3-year Bachelor of Science program is to ensure 
that Canada is able to meet the expected staffing needs for this key safety related profession. The program 
has been verified as satisfying general requirements to enable a student to write exams leading to 
certification in Radiation Protection, which is done through the Canadian Radiation Protection Association.

<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>Health and radiation physicists work in many areas, including research, industry, education, environmental 
protection, and enforcement of government regulations.  Health physicists investigate the basic principles by 
which radiation interacts with matter and living systems.  Applied health physicists draw upon their technical 
knowledge and varied experience to advise and make recommendations regarding methods and equipment 
for use in radiation work.  Health physicists working in education develop and instruct training programs for 
future health physicists.  Those involved in regulatory enforcement must have knowledge and experience 
concerning all types of radiation hazards in order to establish guidelines for adequate radiation control.  
</p>
<p>SAMPLE COURSES 
</p>
<p>Radiation and the Environment: This course provides an overview of radiation in the environment and its 
effects on materials and living systems. Topics will include x-rays, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, microwave 
and radio-frequency emissions, acoustical and ultrasonic radiation, and alpha, beta and gamma radiation 
from radioactive sources. 
</p>
<p>Radiation Biology: This course deals with the fundamentals of radiation biology and focuses on the effects 
of radiation at a cellular and molecular level. This course will be given through CancerCare Manitoba. 
</p>
<p>Radiation Protection & Health Physics: This course reviews the fundamental concepts that are used to 
minimize risk when working with sources of ionizing radiation, with emphasis on the application of these 
concepts to radiation therapy. This course will be given through CancerCare Manitoba.

<p>NOTE: This sample first year is representative of the courses you may take. For many of our programs, you 
may choose another set of courses and still be well on your way to a degree. Also, for most programs you 
do not have to take 30 credit hours (five full courses) in your first year.

<p>"Doing research in physics as an undergraduate student has given me the opportunity to 
learn more about the topics that really interested me. Thanks to my time in the department 
I got to work with some great people and develop as a scientist."
