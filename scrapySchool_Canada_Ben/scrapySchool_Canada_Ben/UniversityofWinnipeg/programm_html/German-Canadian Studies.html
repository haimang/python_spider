<p>German-Canadian Studies encompasses approaches from all of the disciplines in the Humanities and Social 
Sciences, but has been most influenced by History and Literature. In courses and seminars, students seek 
to understand the worldwide migrations from German-speaking Europe and the multiple migrations of 
German-speakers from all over the world to Canada.  
</p>
<p>You will find courses in German-Canadian Studies a useful and informative addition to any liberal arts 
education. Although it is not a Major, the background it provides will be especially relevant to students 
interested in the complexities of migration, immigration, and multiculturalism. The courses also prepare 
students who intend to write MA theses and PhD dissertations in German-Canadian Studies. Students with 
excellent research and German language skills may have opportunities to conduct historical research. 
</p>
<p>The courses in German-Canadian Studies are listed within the Department of History. This means that you 
may focus on, and receive credit for, study in German-Canadian Studies while working toward a Bachelor 
</p>
<p>of Arts degree in History.
