<p>SOCIOLOGY 
</p>
<p>Socio logy is a social science that uses theoret ical and scient if ic methods of research to 
investigate the social world .   
</p>
<p>Sociology is an examination of the relations between the “individual” and “society.”  Studying sociology can 
help you to develop a “sociological imagination” which is a quality of mind that gives us the ability to 
understand our own personal experiences as they are shaped by the society in which we live. Sociology tells 
us how and why certain ideas are taken for granted and become popular and dominant during different 
social, economic, and historical time periods. Sociology is often referred to as the “queen of the social 
sciences” because it uses history, philosophy, economics, and statistics to understand social phenomena 
like crime rates, social inequality, student protest, and changes taking place in capitalist democracies.   
</p>
<p>Sociology students learn a variety of rigorous methods used by contemporary sociologists to understand 
and explain the social world.  In part, this involves developing foundational skills in statistical reasoning, 
qualitative research methods, and sociological theory. A degree in sociology provides the analytical tools 
required for engaged citizenship.   
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree (3-year, 4-year, or Honours) with a Major in Sociology.  
Students taking a degree in another Major may choose to add a Minor in Sociology as a secondary area of 
interest.  Also available through the Sociology Department is a Research Methods Certificate.   
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>Students who graduate with an undergraduate honours degree in sociology go on to advanced study in a 
variety of areas such as law, journalism, social work, criminology, business, and politics. Others find 
employment in government and non-governmental organizations doing advocacy work, social scientific 
research, and community service.

<p> “As a Sociology graduate of The University of Winnipeg, I was able to apply the skills I learned to 
conduct research with the Correctional Service of Canada, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
of Canada, and as a Gladue report writer with Manitoba Justice. In my current role as Director at 
Circles of Support and Accountability, much of what I learned at the University has informed my 
work at this restorative justice initiative, which supports people to safely integrate into the 
community after incarceration.”
