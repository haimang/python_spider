<p>URBAN AND INNER-CITY STUDIES  
</p>
<p>Urban and Inner-City Stud ies is an interd iscip linary major concerned w ith the examination of 
the city, and particu larly the inner city, as a dynamic environment. A special feature of th is 
program is that most courses are offered at our North End Campus at Merchants Corner, 541 
Selkirk Avenue, in order to provide students w ith a deeper insight into important urban issues. 
</p>
<p>The rapid growth of urban poverty, typically associated with racism and inadequate housing and related 
problems, is an especially important problem in cities in Canada and throughout the world today. Urban and 
Inner-City Studies is a program that examines such issues especially closely, and will be of particular 
interest to students with a concern for social justice and positive social change. Our courses focus on such 
issues as: the urban Indigenous experience, poverty, the law and public policy, community development, the 
refugee experience, the role of women in the inner city, and urban and community planning. 
</p>
<p>Cities in Canada continue to face great challenges: managing suburban growth, promoting inner-city 
revitalization, coping with rapidly changing demographics, and dealing with increasing concentrations of 
poverty and social and political exclusion. The UIC program examines all these challenges from an 
interdisciplinary perspective.  
</p>
<p>This program includes two 2-Year Certificates, both of which can lead to a Bachelor of Arts (3-year, 4-
year, or Honours) with a Major in Urban and Inner-City Studies. Students taking an undergraduate degree 
in another Major may add a Minor in Urban and Inner-City Studies as a secondary area of interest. 
</p>

<p>Graduates can pursue a career in any of the following: city planning; law; government departments dealing

<p>“I learned a lot from the UIC program at UWinnipeg.  I first learned about 
community organizing, urban planning and the implications of poverty 
within an urban environment.  I had amazing, understanding, 
compassionate teachers and professors.  This program gave me the 
confidence to pursue my dreams of a higher education.”
