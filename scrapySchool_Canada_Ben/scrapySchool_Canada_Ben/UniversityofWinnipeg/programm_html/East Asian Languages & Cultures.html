</p>
<p>The study of East As ia (Ch ina, Korea and Japan) prepares one to meet the chal lenges of the 
future .   
</p>
<p>The East Asian region constitutes one of the most dynamic and intellectually rich regions in the world. The 
impact of East Asian economic development has been keenly felt in recent decades and the region has a 
major impact on world affairs. The legacy of East Asian history, religious and social values, literatures, etc., 
is a major factor in current affairs in the region, and this legacy will continue to shape our global future. 
</p>
<p>The EALC program is devoted to the study of East Asian societies through two components:  
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>the study of  languages (Chinese—Mandarin and Classical, Korean and Japanese), and  
the study of cultures through a multi-disciplinary approach (Religion & Culture, History, Literature, 
Cinema, Economics, International Development Studies, Politics).  
</p>
<p>The EALC program is administered through the Department of Religion & Culture.   
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree (3-year or 4-year) . Students tak ing an 
</p>
<p>undergraduate degree in another Ma jor may choose to add a M inor in EALC as a secondary area of 
interest. 
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>Students who are interested in careers related to East Asia in fields such as education, government, 
journalism, economics, and business benefit greatly from courses in East Asian Languages & Cultures. 
</p>
<p>SAMPLE COURSES 
</p>
<p>East Asian Cultural Foundations introduces students to the cultural traditions and belief systems of East 
Asia (primarily China, Japan, and Korea). Traditions examined include Confucianism, Daoism (Taoism), and 
Buddhism.  
</p>
<p>East Asian Martial Arts challenges the portrayal of East Asian martial arts as an ancient, mystical practice 
by examining the history of martial arts. Students explore how military techniques once intended for war, 
policing, and control of banditry came to be practiced as methods of moral and physical self-cultivation.  
</p>
<p>Introduction to Japanese Language provides a solid base in vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation 
through speaking, listening, writing, and reading exercises. Students are introduced to Japanese syllabary 
(hiragana and katakana) and basic Japanese characters (kanji).
