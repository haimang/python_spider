</p>
<p>CHEMISTRY  
</p>
<p>Chemistry is the study of the composition and properties of mat ter, the transformations they 
undergo , and the associated energ ies.  
</p>
<p>Chemists are at the forefront of unravelling the mysteries of the most complex chemical systems. If you are 
interested in understanding the structure of matter and how it behaves on a molecular level, you may be 
drawn to the field of chemistry. Chemical science plays a role in dealing with many challenges today, from 
pollution and the scarcity of fresh water, to food production and the development of vaccines and drugs.  
</p>
<p>At The University of Winnipeg you can specialize in analytical, organic, inorganic, or physical chemistry; or in 
biochemistry.   
</p>
<p>The Chemistry Department at UWinnipeg offers research and work opportunities through summer jobs and 
a fourth year “Research Projects” course. The skills gained through these research and work opportunities 
are valuable in future employment and for admission to graduate and professional schools. 
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Science degree (3-year, 4-year, or Honours). A lso, p lease see 
</p>
<p>re lated fact sheets on “B ioChem istry” and “Applied Chemistry” (a joint program with Red River 
College). 
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>As a “central science,” chemistry provides excellent preparation for a career in science as a teacher,  
a professional (e.g. medical doctor, pharmacist), a technician, or a researcher/academic. Chemistry 
graduates may find employment in federal or provincial government laboratories, industrial laboratories, 
hospital laboratories, or with pharmaceutical or chemical companies.

<p>SAMPLE COURSES 
</p>
<p>Introduct ion to the Chemical Properties of Matter and Basic Princip les of Chem ical React ivity 
</p>
<p>are f irst-year courses that exam ine the pr inc ip les of the four core areas of chem istry: organ ic, 
inorgan ic, ana lyt ica l, and phys ica l. Labora tory work introduces some o f the bas ic techn iques of 
pract ica l chem istry. 
</p>
<p>Organ ic Chem istry I and I I are second-year courses that introduce the chem istry of carbon and 
desc r ibe the nature of organ ic compounds and the ir behav iours. Nomenc lature and stereochem istry 
are descr ibed, as we l l as me thods for the syn thes is and character izat ion of these compounds.

<p>NOTE: This sample first year is representative of the courses you may take. For many of our programs, you 
may choose another set of courses and still be well on your way to a degree. Also, for most programs you 
do not have to take 30 credit hours (five full courses) in your first year. 
</p>
<p>“The small size of the Chemistry department allowed me to gain access to the professors, 
get valuable hands-on experience in the labs as both a student and a lab teaching 
assistant, and participate in the organization of an undergraduate chemistry conference.”
