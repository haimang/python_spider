<p>FACULTY OF ARTS  
</p>
<p>HISTORY 
</p>
<p>H istory is the study of past ind ividua ls and groups , processes and events, and ideas and 
inst itut ions . 
</p>
<p>Historians examine a variety of evidence from written, oral, material, and visual sources to help them 
interpret the past. As a history student, you will explore the careers of major figures, like Marie Curie and 
Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther and Martin Luther King Jr., Chief Peguis and Justice Murray Sinclair. You 
will also study the everyday experiences of people who worked to secure their own livelihoods and shape 
their own destinies.  
</p>
<p>The Department offers a wide range of courses across time and space but has particular strengths in: 
</p>
<p> Canadian History  
 History of Medicine and Science 
 
Indigenous History 
</p>
<p> World History 
 History of Art 
 Oral History 
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree (3-year, 4-year, or Honours). Students taking an 
</p>
<p>undergraduate degree in another Major may choose to add a Minor in History as a secondary area of 
interest.  We also offer a joint Master’s program with the University of Manitoba – see separate fact sheet. 
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>The skills students develop -- reading, document review, synthesis, writing, public speaking, interviewing, 
time-management -- are invaluable in virtually all workplace settings and especially in business, law, 
government, and journalism. Some graduates put their historical knowledge to work as teachers or 
professional researchers while others find employment in museums, libraries, or archives.
