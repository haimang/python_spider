adapt to change, can think critically and analyze effectively, can speak and write clearly, and can be counted 
on to find creative and innovative solutions to problems.

<p>This combination of technique and artistry in dance, together with a broad-based university education, is 
designed to prepare students to be performers and artists of wide-ranging and deep perceptiveness.

special projects, and a tour of Winnipeg-area schools. The School of Contemporary Dancers is one of a 
small number of institutions to be recognized by the Federal Department of Canadian Heritage as a national

<p>“I graduated from the University of Winnipeg’s Dance Program in affiliation with the Professional 
Program of the School of Contemporary Dancers in June 2015.  The Program is a nationally 
renowned centre for contemporary dance training in Canada and the quality of training I received 
was outstanding.  The connections I made with my peers, teachers and the professional community 
greatly supported my transition into the profession. Not only was the Program itself incredible, it 
was also an excellent preparation for a performance career in contemporary dance.”
