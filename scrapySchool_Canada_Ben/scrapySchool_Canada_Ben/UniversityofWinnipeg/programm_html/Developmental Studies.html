</p>
<p>Developmental Studies draws perspectives and methods from many disciplines to provide a coherent 
analysis of development. As such, it has specific relevance to a growing number of occupations and 
professions, especially in the areas of child care, gerontology, and family studies.  There are three streams 
available within the Developmental Studies Program: 
</p>
<p>A – Individual Human Development: This stream concentrates on individual human development, ranging 
from prenatal and infant development to adolescent psychology and gerontology. 
</p>
<p>B – Comparative Biological Development: This stream is concerned with animal development, ranging from 
animal physiology, chemistry, and genetics to evolution, zoology, and primatology. 
</p>
<p>C – Child Development and Child Care: This is a joint program offered by The University of Winnipeg and 
either Red River College or the Université de Saint-Boniface. See separate fact sheet for details.   
</p>
<p>Streams A, B, and C lead to a three-year Bachelor of Arts degree. Stream C additionally leads to a two-
year Diploma in Early Childhood Education. 
</p>
<p>Another option is the Advanced Diploma in Leadership in Early Chilhood Care and Education (ECCE), which 
is designed for childcare professionals who already have experience in the field.  For more information, 
please contact Stephanie Rozzi, Academic Advisor, at 204.786.9972 or s.rozzi@uwinnipeg.ca. 
</p>
<p>Some students may wish to enroll in the Faculty of Education, and complete a Bachelor of Education, with a 
teachable minor in Developmental Studies. 
</p>
<p>CAREER OPPORTUNITIES 
</p>
<p>Graduates may find employment in a variety of governmental and non-governmental agencies dealing with
