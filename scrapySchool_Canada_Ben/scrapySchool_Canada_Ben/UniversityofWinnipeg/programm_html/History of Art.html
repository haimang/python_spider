</p>
<p>HISTORY OF ART 
</p>
<p>History of art stud ies the relationsh ip between a soc iety and its artistic ach ievements.   
</p>
<p>Art has the ability to transform space and create dialogue that invokes social change throughout different 
moments of time and various societies. Works of art and buildings have shaped our world with marvel and 
intrigue. Have you ever wondered how Michelangelo came to produce one of the world’s most influential 
works on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, or why artist Emily Carr became so highly admired, or how the 
prehistoric indigenous petroforms in the Whiteshell Provincial Park were made, and what was their symbolic 
function? If so, you may find history of art a fascinating field of study.  
</p>
<p>As an interdisciplinary program, History of Art allows you to customize your university education to fit your 
educational and career goals by taking courses from different disciplines, such as Indigenous Studies, 
English, Theatre and Film, Classics, Religion and Culture, and Philosophy. 
</p>

<p> “The Curatorial Practices course allowed me to get hands-on experience in mounting an exhibition 
in conjunction with the Buhler Gallery at St. Boniface Hospital. This experience helped me gain 
practical skills related to the curatorial practices field, and gave me confidence in knowing that I am 
indeed on the right path.”
