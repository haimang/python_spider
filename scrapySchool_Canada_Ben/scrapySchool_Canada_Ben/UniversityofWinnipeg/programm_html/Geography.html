<p>GEOGRAPHY 
</p>
<p>Geography is a discipline that integrates the natural and social sciences; it explains how 
human and environmental systems function and interact. 
</p>
<p>The University of Winnipeg Geography program is divided into four areas of study: 
</p>
<p>Physical Geography examines components of the natural environment including landforms, weather and 
climate, soils and vegetative systems, and their impacts on humans. 
</p>
<p>Human Geography focuses on variations in the “human landscape” around the world–its agricultural 
systems, cities, industries, cultural expressions, and the particular problems faced by different societies. 
</p>
<p>Regional Geography combines both the physical and human features within specific areas of the world and 
provides a comprehensive understanding of the area in question. 
</p>
<p>Geomatics courses develop skills in cartography, map reading, interpretation of satellite images, and— 
using the department’s computer labs—computer mapping, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), 
satellite image analysis, and statistical data analysis. 
</p>
<p>This program can lead to a Bachelor of Science Degree (3-year, 4-year, or Honours) or a Bachelor of 
</p>
<p>Arts Degree (3-year, 4-year, or Honours).  Students taking an undergraduate degree in another major 
may choose to add a Minor in Geography as a secondary area of interest. 
</p>
<p>NOTE:  The joint Geography/GIS program with Red River College has been discontinued. 
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>Those who specialize in human or regional geography find employment related to planning (city, rural, or 
regional), policy development, market assessment, location of business and industry, international 
development, and tourism. 
</p>
<p>Physical geographers work in natural resource assessment and management, agricultural development, soil 
and resource conservation, hydrology, and the atmospheric and geological sciences. 
</p>
<p>Those who focus on geomatics find jobs related to cartography, remote sensing, and in particular, 
applications of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). 
</p>
<p>If you’re interested in becoming a teacher, Geography can be used as a teachable major or minor in the 
Education Program. Postgraduate training in geography can lead to teaching opportunities at colleges and 
universities, or to research positions in government or industry.
