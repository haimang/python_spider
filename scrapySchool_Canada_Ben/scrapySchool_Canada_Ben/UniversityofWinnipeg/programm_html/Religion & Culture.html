<p>FACULTY OF ARTS 
</p>
<p>RELIGION & CULTURE 
</p>
<p>The study of rel ig ion focuses on the human search for mean ing and purpose in l ife. 
</p>
<p>If you want to understand where the search for meaning and purpose has taken some of the world’s people, 
consider pursuing religious studies. Religion & Culture at The University of Winnipeg will familiarize you with 
the quest for meaning and purpose as it is expressed in stories, rituals, codes of conduct, canonical texts, 
and cultural values. 
</p>
<p>The Religion & Culture program does not promote any one religion or any particular faith; we study religion 
as an important aspect of culture and society and promote critical enquiry, understanding, and tolerance. We 
explore religion in four areas: Historical Judaism, Christianity, and Islam; Religion and Modern Western 
Culture; Asian Religions and Cultures; and Indigenous Religious Traditions. The scope of religions we cover 
ranges from traditional Western religions like Judaism and Christianity, to local Indigenous traditions, Islam, 
and Asian traditions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism).  
</p>
<p>This program leads to a Bachelor of Arts (3-year, 4-year, or Honours) with a Major in Religion & Culture. 
The Department of Religion & Culture also offers a Joint Master’s program in cooperation with the University 
of Manitoba.   Students taking an undergraduate degree in another Major may choose to add a Minor in 
Religion & Culture as a secondary area of interest. 
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS

<p>If you are interested in fields where human interaction and/or multiculturalism are significant factors, such as 
education, mediation services, social work, employee relations, immigration services, international 
development, and certain branches of law, you will benefit greatly from courses in Religion & Culture.
