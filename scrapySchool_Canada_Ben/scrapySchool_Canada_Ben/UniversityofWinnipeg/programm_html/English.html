<p>“It was a wonderful experience being a student at The University of Winnipeg. 
High calibre faculty challenged me to do my best. I believe I benefited from the 
small collegial atmosphere of the university with professors who are available and 
accessible to students. It helped make me the student I was then and the teacher I 
am now.”
