<p>SCIENCE-BUSINESS STREAM 
</p>
<p>Students pursu ing a BSc (3-year, 4-year or Honours) in any department or program have the 
opportun ity to supp lemen t the ir ma in course of study in science w ith a “Business Stream” – a 
set of core courses in the Facu lty of Bus iness that w ill provide them w ith the sk i l ls needed to 
enter and succeed in industry and business. 
</p>
<p>The Science-Business Stream addresses the growing demand for University graduates in science to have 
the basic skill sets needed to function in a business environment.  In particular, there is an expanding private 
sector in the life sciences, which includes everything from pharmaceutical companies making designer drugs 
to environmental consultants specializing in remediation.  Also, science students who expect to proceed to a 
professional school (Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, etc.) can benefit from this degree stream since many 
will be involved in running their own small business when they practice their profession.  
</p>
<p>This stream can supplement almost any Bachelor of Science degree (3-year, 4-year, or Honours). After 
</p>
<p>completing the requirements of the BSc degree and a set of core courses, it will be noted on the student’s 
transcript that they have satisfied the requirements of a BSc degree with a Business stream. 
</p>
<p>Participating programs: Applied Computer Science, Bioanthropology, Biochemistry, Biology, Biopsychology, 
Chemistry, Environmental Studies, Geography, Kinesiology, Mathematics, Physics, and Statistics. 
</p>
<p>SAMPLE CAREERS 
</p>
<p>Career opportunities for graduates of this program lie in science-oriented industries such as food 
technology, pest control, environmental consulting, the design and manufacture of pharmaceuticals and 
diagnostics. Graduates may work in government or university labs or a variety of private industries.  Those 
who proceed to professional school (Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, etc.) and plan to open their own 
practice will also benefit from this stream.
